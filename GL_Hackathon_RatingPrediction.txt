The goal of this hackathon is to predict GreatStone’s rating as a mutual fund. In order to help investors decide on which mutual fund to pick for an investment, the task is to build a model that can predict the rating of a mutual fund. The various attributes that define a mutual fund can be used for building the model. 

Evaluation Criteria: Mean Precision Score

Mean of precision of all the classes = P1+P2/2  Here P1 is the Precision of  Class 1 and P2 is the Precision of Class2.
